# Unit Testing working notes

To run these in this setup 

Option 1 - Command line using unittest

from the mytest directory (where program and test) are children  to command line run a single test
`python -m unittest test.test_module` 

or
~python -m test.test_module`   (since we have the __name__ == '__main__' line in it)
